# Usage

This folder only exists for debugging missing translations via the Easy I18N plugin for JetBrains IDEs.
Updating this file and pushing it will not update the production translations!

# Source of translations

All translations are fetched on page load, from the WordPress instance, which hosts a `translations.json` file.

That file must be downloaded, deleted from Media, updated locally and then re-uploaded under the same name. Browsers might cache the file, so updating for everyone might take a while.
